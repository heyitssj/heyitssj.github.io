  <h2> <strong> <em> My Story: </em> </strong> </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
  Hi! My name is Sarah, and piano has been an essential part of my life since I was 11-12. I'm 16 now. When I first started taking piano lessons, I absolutely hated it. However, as I contnued to attend these classes every Saturday, I slowly began to fall in love with it. I have learned many things about myself since then, and I’ve continued to do so. If you haven’t learned this skill, I suggest you learn it. It doesn't matter if you consider yourself to be too "young" or too "old". There's something for everyone to learn. I guarantee that you’ll learn new things about yourself, and develop others. I promise that you won’t regret it.
